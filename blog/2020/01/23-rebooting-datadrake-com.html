Well, here we are at the start of another new year.
</p>
<p>
I am not really one for New Year's Resolutions. People tend to make promises to themselves
that they will never end up keeping. Promises I myself have broken many times. But this
year I have decided that it is time to do something with this website, even if it does not
amount to much of anything.
</p>
<p>
When I created this domain years ago, it was actually going to be used to launch a company
my friend and I were thinking up at the time. When that did not end up panning out, I
eventually assumed DataDrake as my pseudonym for open-source development. When I build the
first version of datadrake.com, it ended up becoming a sort of resume or curriculum vitae
for myself. And so it has sat, largely unchanged for most of the last decade, a placeholder
for when I would eventually do something real with it. And in some ways, standing as a
monolith, marking my failure to previously do so. Now, I would like to use it to share my
thoughts, the projects I am working on, and the things I create.
</p>
<p>
The overall revamp of the site is still a work-in-progress while I get a feel for how I would
like things to be organized. You should expect that tt will probably take a month or so for
the format and layout to stabilize. When I get to that point, I plan on implementing RSS feeds
to make it easier to keep tabs on new content that I have added and probably social media links
for sharing things. Comment sections are off the table, since I do not really have the time to
moderate them, nor do I possess the desire to deal with all of the negativity that they tend to
cause. Such is the Internet in 2020.
</p>
<p>
At this point, there is no set schedule for when new content will be uploaded. I would like for
things to settle into a weekly or bi-weekly publishing cycle for the Blog itself. Other content
will be added periodically as it is created and I have a chance to write about it. Eventually,
I will set up some way of providing direct feedback about the site. But I will likely rely on
commentary from Twitter if you are looking to provide suggestions or constructive criticism.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all for your patience as I get into the swing of things. It has been a long time
since I have make a conscious effort to have an Internet presence, so we shall have to count
this as a learning experience as I drag myself kicking and screaming into the 2020's. I am
looking forward to this opportunity to freely express myself and I hope you will join me for
the wild ride ahead.
