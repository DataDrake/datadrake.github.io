Welcome back to Meditative Musings!
</p>
<p class='text-center'>
This post was inspired by a recent
<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/f55710/serious_questions_about_opensourcing_my_master_of/'>Reddit post</a>
over on /r/linux.
</p>
<h3>Why should I open-source my video game?</h3>
<p>
For someone who has spent countless hours developing their game engine, assets, and vision into a full-blown
video game for people to play, the answer may not be obvious at first. Surely, you want to get some sort of
compensation for your troubles. What you just went through is a difficult process that not everyone is able to
successfully complete, let alone make profitable. And now I seem to be suggesting that you just put it all out
there, seemingly free for whoever wants it. Well, let me explain a bit better what I mean and give you some
incentives to do this.
</p>
<h4>1. No one is saying do it for free.</h4>
<p>
No, really! I think you can and should sell your game for as long as you so desire. You have worked hard to
make it this far and deserve to be compensated. Not every developer can make it on donations and good will.
I am not suggesting you just give all that away, but I am suggesting you can do a better job than other game
developers in how you release your game into the world.
</p>
<h4>2. What happens to your game when you die or move on to other things?</h4>
<p>
This is actually a pretty serious problem in the history of games. It's not at all uncommon for a developer
to release their game to market, provide bug fixes and updates for a number of months or years, and then stop
altogether. This is just the natural progression of games. Even moreso for Indie development where you must
move on to your next project and can't afford to spend too much time continuing to support your previous works.
The problem gets even worse when you are working on a multiplayer game and the servers are officially shut-down
after years of operation. In both of these cases, you have now left the gamers in limbo, without any ability to
continue enjoying your hard work for years to come.
</p>
<h3>How do I open-source my game and still make money?</h3>
<p>
There probably isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but permit me to provide you with a roadmap
for one possible direction you might take and to give you my reasoning for why I think it is a good model. You
have nothing to lose, but a bit of your time reading this and are welcome to brush me off after. I just want
to provide an alternative to the current model of game releases.
</p>
<h4>Part 1: Profitability</h4>
<p>
You should still sell your game on whatever platforms you desire. This closed-source experience is the game
that you wanted to ship in its purest form and where you will be most compensated for making the game. No one
will blame you for trying to get something in return for all your hardships.
</p>
<h4>Part 2: Transparency</h4>
<p>
Release the source code for your game and its engine under an open-source license, without the assets. There
is no cost to you in doing this. You may even be able to crowd-source some of the burden of maintenance or
even porting your game to other platforms. Especially if you release on a collaborative platform like Gitlab
or Github. When you move on from this game to other things, the source will now always be available to allow
people to continue keeping your game working for years or decades to come.
</p>
<h4>Part 3: Legacy</h4>
<p>
At some point, your game will no longer bring in much profit. Especially after years of being available for
purchase. At this point you will have recouped your costs on development and hopefully made a decent profit.
To ensure that your game continues to be played well into the future, I suggest that you release the assets
under a permissive license (e.g. Creative Commons) to ensure that it does not become embroiled in copyright
abuses sometime after your passing. This is an all to common problem with creative works, especially in the
United States where copyright can extend for centuries after your passing.
</p>
<h4>Sweetening the Deal</h4>
<p>
I think there are also a few tweaks to this approach that you might make in order for both creator and
consumer to get a bit more out of the process:
</p>
<ol class='pad-2'>
<li>
Release the source code as a perk of purchasing the full game from one of the usual distribution
platforms. This rewards the gamers with the ability to someday continue to use your game when it stops
working as-is.
</li>
<li>
Open-source your game while still selling the assets to users for the full game price. You will still
make a profit on the game, but can crowd-source bug fixes and porting.
</li>
<li>
Start your game as open-source from day one. As an Indie developer, this enables you to actively
collaborate with a part of your fan-base. They can send you bug reports and suggestions for the game,
while receiving recognition for their small part in the design process and the final game. You also
gain the ability to crowd-source some of your testing for early-adopters.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I could probably continue talking about this subject at length, but for now I just hope you all learned a
little something from my ramblings. Best wishes for the games you are developing!
