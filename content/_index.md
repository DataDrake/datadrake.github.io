So, you managed to find this place. My quiet little corner of the interwebs and the blogosphere.

*Now what?*

Here you'll find a collection of my thoughts, passions, and hobbies. If you
stick around long enough, I hope you'll be able to find something that
resonates with you. If you keep coming back, I'll try my best to hold up my
end of the bargain and continue adding new content for you to enjoy.

If you'd like to know a bit more about who I am, check out my
[About Me](/about) page. Over on my [Blog](/blog) you'll find conversations
about thought experiments, programming projects, tech news, and more. If you
are interested in the [Projects](/projects) I am working on, I've highlighted
the ones I'm the most proud of. From time to time, I also dabble in a little
photography and digital art. You can find the resulting albums in
[Photos](/photos) Some people might prefer to see me in in action over in
the [Videos](/videos) section, where I keep a listing of my most-recent
livestreams and vlogs. Lastly, [Links](/links)  contains a compilation of
some of my favorite websites, books, and papers that I think you'll find
interesting.

*Thanks for stopping by!*
