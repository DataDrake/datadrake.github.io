# Under Construction

This part of the site will eventually act as a place for quickly finding videos related to projects, presentations, announcements, etc. that I record and want to share with you. Most likely, you will find screen captures from software in action, IRL recordings of hardware projects springing to life, the odd "How To" video, recordings of presentations from conferences or announcements, or little demonstrations of products that I buy.
